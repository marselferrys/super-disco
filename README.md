To build a predictive model that can forecast the next product a customer is likely to purchase, we can approach it as a recommendation problem. We can use collaborative filtering techniques, which are commonly used in recommendation systems for e-commerce platforms. Collaborative filtering predicts a customer's preference for products based on the preferences of similar customers.

Given the problem statement and data description provided, we have the following datasets:

- Customer Interactions: Contains information about customer interactions on the website.
- Purchase History: Contains records of customer purchases.
- Product Details: Provides details about each product.

Here's how we can proceed:

**Data Preprocessing:**

1. Merge the datasets based on the common identifiers (Customer ID, Product ID) to create a comprehensive dataset.
2. Handle missing values and perform data cleaning if necessary.
3. Extract relevant features that can be used for modeling, such as customer behavior features, product features, and purchase history.

**Feature Engineering:**

1. Create features that capture customer behavior, such as total page views, average time spent on the website, frequency of purchases, etc.
2. Incorporate product features like category, price, ratings, etc.
3. Consider temporal features such as recency of purchase, frequency of purchases, etc.

**Model Selection:**

- For this recommendation problem, we can use collaborative filtering techniques such as:
  - User-based collaborative filtering: Recommends products to a user that similar users have liked.
  - Item-based collaborative filtering: Recommends items similar to those that a user has liked.
- Alternatively, matrix factorization techniques like Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) or more advanced methods like matrix factorization using neural networks (e.g., Embedding-based models) can be considered.

**Model Training:**

1. Split the data into training and validation sets to evaluate the model's performance.
2. Train the chosen model on the training data.

**Model Evaluation:**

- Evaluate the model using appropriate evaluation metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), or others suitable for recommendation systems.
- Tune hyperparameters if necessary to improve model performance.

**Deployment:**

1. Develop a web-based application where users can input their customer ID, and the application provides recommendations for the next product to purchase.
2. Ensure the application is user-friendly and provides clear recommendations based on the trained model.

**Reasons for Model Selection:**

- Collaborative filtering techniques are chosen for the following reasons:
  - Scalability: Collaborative filtering techniques are scalable and can handle large datasets efficiently.
  - Personalization: These techniques provide personalized recommendations based on individual user preferences and behaviors.
  - Ease of Implementation: Collaborative filtering methods are relatively easy to implement and interpret compared to more complex models.
  - Effectiveness: Collaborative filtering has been widely used and proven effective in various recommendation systems, especially in e-commerce platforms.

Based on the data provided and the nature of the problem, collaborative filtering is a suitable choice for building a predictive model for recommending products to customers in an e-commerce setting.
